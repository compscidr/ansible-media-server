## CRITICAL: Always Check ansible-lint Before Completion

**MANDATORY STEP**: Before marking any task as "completed" or "done", ALWAYS run:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && ansible-lint
```

### Why This Matters:
- ansible-lint failures will cause CI to fail
- Common issues: trailing spaces, missing newlines, YAML formatting
- Must be 0 failures, 0 warnings for CI to pass

### Process:
1. Complete the task
2. Run ansible-lint 
3. Fix any failures
4. Re-run ansible-lint to verify 0 failures
5. ONLY THEN mark task as complete

### Common Fixes:
- Trailing spaces: `sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' filename.yml`
- Missing newlines: `echo "" >> filename.yml`
- YAML formatting: Use proper indentation and structure

**NO EXCEPTIONS** - Every change to YAML files must pass ansible-lint before being considered complete.
